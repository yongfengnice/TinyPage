# TinyPage

TinyPage is a new framework , a new way to componentize android app development.

#### 1. One Activity contains as many Page as you want.

#### 2. One activity can be responsible for one or more module.

#### 3. One app can contains more than noe module.

#### 4. below are some introduce
    1) tiny-page: core library,so little code as you can get it easily.
    2) app : show a activity to contain many pages.
    3) module-activity : show another activity to contain many other pages.
    4) module-dialog : demonstrate to show dialog such as AlertDialog,PopWindow and so on normally.
    5) module-mvp : show myself thought about mvp develop mode,may be much different from you.
    6) module-push : show push message and open app with many mode normally.
    7) module-third : show how to call third part activity and get the result as so easily as before.

#### 5. this is only my simple thought, a new way to componentize. maybe you like it and can give it a star or can contribute it.thanks.
